# Old Projects

## Character Language Modelling
I built a chargram language model with a partner for coursework in the Accelerated Natural Language Processing course we had at the University of Edinburgh in Fall 2018. It can be used to filter and score sentences that may contain unknown languages by using perplexity.

Find that project [here](https://github.com/klebster2/chargram-model).
